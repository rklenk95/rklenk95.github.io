        <p class="project-name">LibreFoodPantry</p>
        <p class="project-description">This is the project I am currently working on. LibreFoodPantry is an open-source software that will 
            help local food pantries serve their guests better. I am working on the inventory subsystem as part of a team of five peers. We 
            are using GitLab for version control and to run it through a CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, we are using Docker to develop the code, 
            so it can run on any machine. We are using the Scrum framework to organize our work as a team. I am working on both the front-end 
            and back-end of the project. Some of my accomplishments so far include updating parts of the front-end and back-end to meet the product 
            owner's specifications and writing tests for the back-end.

        <p class="project-name">Operation Hydration - App</p>
        <p class="project-description">This is an Android app I developed to help users track how much water they are drinking throughout the day and 
            set a goal for how much water they want to drink. The goal can be set manually or calculated based on the user's age and weight. The user 
            can input how much water they have had in either cups or ounces, and the app will automatically convert it to cups when displaying their 
            progress. I developed this app using Android Studio and Java.

        <p class="project-name">Restaurant Project</p>
        <p class="project-description">In this project I created a menu based system for a restaurant. The user can view the restaurant's menu as well
            as add to it or remove items from it. This system also allows for orders to be taken. The orders can be viewed and then marked as the customer
            has been served to remove them from the list. I utilized Java as the programming language, implementing multiple data structures and object-oriented 
            design principles to create the system.

        <p class="project-name">Store Managment System</p>
        <p class="project-description">This project involved creating a database in MySQL and developing a Java application to access and manipulate 
            the data. I designed and populated the database with the information needed for a video game store, including inventory, transactions, employee 
            information, and customer information. Additionally, I implemented different levels of access based on user roles. The Java application has a 
            menu-based interface, allowing users to navigate to sub-menus and perform actions based on their privileges after logging in.
