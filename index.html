        <p>         I'm a Software Engineer with a background in developing embedded systems, flight control software, and internal tools for 
            complex hardware platforms. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Worcester State University and have professional 
            experience working on advanced unmanned aerial systems, including the KARGO UAV program at Kaman Air Vehicles.
            <br><br>
            My technical skill set includes C, C++, Python, C#/.NET, shell scripting, and DevOps tools. I've contributed to real-time and 
            mission-critical software systems, supported system integration and testing, and created automation tools to improve engineering 
            workflows. I'm passionate about building efficient, reliable software for high-impact applications.</p>

        <p class="project-name">Software Engineer – Kaman Air Vehicles (March 2023 – April 2025)</p>
        <p class="project-description">
            Contributed to the development of the <strong>KARGO UAV</strong>, a medium-lift autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 
            designed to support expeditionary logistics missions for both the U.S. military and commercial clients.
            <br><br>
            As part of a multidisciplinary engineering team, I focused on embedded systems, flight control, and internal tooling to support 
            aircraft performance, autonomy, and system integration. I developed embedded C/C++ software for flight control and vehicle 
            management computers. I also supported system integration testing, evaluated Linux-based embedded systems 
            for avionics, and assisted in implementing a secure satellite-based beyond line of sight (BLOS) communication link between the 
            aircraft and ground station.
            <br><br>
            Additional work included modifying in-house Windows-based C#/.NET tools for hardware testing and simulation, writing Python and 
            shell scripts to automate software processes, and contributing to the development of a custom triplex autopilot using ArduPilot 
            and real-time microcontroller firmware.

        <p class="project-name">LibreFoodPantry</p>
        <p class="project-description">LibreFoodPantry is an open-source software that helps local food pantries enhance their services by managing operations and 
            facilitating coordination with food banks. As part of a team of five peers, I focused on the inventory subsystem, which was one of the three subsystems 
            of the system. Our work involved developing three front-end components, a back-end system, and the corresponding API for seamless communication.
            To streamline our development process, we utilized GitLab for hosting the project and implementing a CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, we employed Docker for 
            code development, ensuring compatibility across various machines. Our team embraced the Scrum framework for efficient organization and collaboration.
            Within the project, I contributed to both the front-end and back-end development. Some notable accomplishments include updating sections of the front-end 
            and back-end to meet the product owner's specifications, as well as writing tests for the back-end.

        <p class="project-name">Operation Hydration - App</p>
        <p class="project-description">I developed an Android app designed to help users improve their health by tracking their water intake throughout the day. 
            The app enables users to set personalized water consumption goals, either manually or by leveraging calculations based on their age and weight. Users 
            can input their water intake in either cups or ounces, with automatic conversion to cups for progress tracking. The app was developed using Android Studio and Java.

        <p class="project-name">Restaurant Project</p>
        <p class="project-description">In this project I created a menu based system for a restaurant. The user can view the restaurant's menu as well
            as add to it or remove items from it. This system also allows for orders to be taken. The orders can be viewed and then marked as the customer
            has been served to remove them from the list. I utilized Java as the programming language, implementing multiple data structures and object-oriented 
            design principles to create the system.

        <p class="project-name">Store Management System</p>
        <p class="project-description">This project involved creating a database in MySQL and developing a Java application to access and manipulate 
            the data. I designed and populated the database with the information needed for a video game store, including inventory, transactions, employee 
            information, and customer information. Additionally, I implemented role based access which include the roles of store clerk, manager, and owner. 
            The Java application has a CLI-based interface, allowing users to navigate to sub-menus and perform actions based on their privileges after logging in.
