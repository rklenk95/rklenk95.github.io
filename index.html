        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineer with a background in developing embedded systems, flight control software, and internal tools for
          complex hardware platforms. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Worcester State University and have professional
          experience working on advanced unmanned aerial systems, including the KARGO UAV program at Kaman Air Vehicles.
          <br /><br />
          My technical skill set includes C, C++, Python, C#/.NET, shell scripting, and DevOps tools. I've contributed to real-time and mission-critical 
          software systems, supported system integration and testing, and created automation tools to improve engineering workflows. I'm passionate about 
          building efficient, reliable software for high-impact applications.

      <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <div class="experience-entry">
        <h3>Kaman Air Vehicles</h3>
        <span class="duration">Software Engineer | June 2023 – April 2025</span>
        <p>
          Contributed to the development of the <strong>KARGO UAV</strong>, a medium-lift autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
          designed for expeditionary logistics missions for both the U.S. military and commercial clients.
          <br /><br />
          As part of a multidisciplinary engineering team, I focused on embedded systems, flight control, and internal tooling to support
          aircraft performance, autonomy, and system integration. I developed embedded C/C++ software for flight control, vehicle
          management, and mission management computers. I also supported system integration testing, evaluated Linux-based embedded systems
          for avionics, and assisted in implementing a secure satellite-based beyond line of sight (BLOS) communication link between the
          aircraft and ground station.
          <br /><br />
          Additional work included modifying in-house Windows-based C#/.NET tools for hardware testing and simulation, writing Python and
          shell scripts to automate software processes, and contributing to the development of a custom triplex autopilot using ArduPilot
          and real-time microcontroller firmware.
